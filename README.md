# 🛠️ Flask API Template [![](https://img.shields.io/github/license/yuting1214/flask_api_template)](https://github.com/yuting1214/flask_api_template/blob/main/LICENSE)

This is a REST API built with Flask and Connexion, using SQLAlchemy as the ORM and Marshmallow for object serialization/deserialization. It provides a simple interface for managing people and their associated notes.

For the Front-End, it also provides examples to implement Ajax communication for client-side updates.
See more in apps/static/js, specifically in request.js, index.js, and people.js.

Users can enhance their understanding of integrating client-side and server-side components, using this repository as a solid foundation to build upon for their own web applications.
